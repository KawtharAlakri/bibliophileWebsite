# Bibliophile Website 
This is a basic book reviews website developed as a project for 'Web Development with No-SQL' course. 

## Introduction
Reading communities is a crucial thing that if provided, readers will be influenced by the knowledge they get more clearly. As a reader, I believe that having the opportunity to hear from other readers, their opinion about a book, how did they saw the story from their point of view, and get recommendations is a great thing. As a sequence, my project goal is to create a user-friendly book reviews website that helps reader collaborate and make their reading journey more effective, by adding and reviewing their favorite books.
